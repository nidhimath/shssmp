							<h1> Meet the Mentors</h1>
							<p>Saratoga alumni have volunteered to lead projects, teach, mentor, and discuss with current SHS students, providing an amazing opportunity for current high school students to
								learn more about what life is like after high school and how the experiences of these college students shaped their path. Learn from their success and their mistakes, and most
								importantly, take this opportunity to further explore what you would like to do in high school, college, and beyond.
